# Codecademy_Biodiversity

This is one of many projects from Codecademy's Data Analysis Skill Path. Please if there are things I need to know, just hit me up!

a few things about this data:
- this data contains columns of : category (the class of animals/plants), species, common name, conservation status
- this data was inspired from real data AND might be modificated (i am not sure enough, but i looks just fine)
